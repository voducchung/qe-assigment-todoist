# Guide to this assigment

## Test plans:

All test plans are shared Google docs:

- [Item Management Feature TRD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ys1FRKExNcPI3sBmEzAc5yqO-b3JDfT67gSklyCl_mA/edit?usp=sharing) for Item Management feature
- [Google Calendar Integration TRD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ESzgVqJkDfSyI74rrQBwqtjcih-NYX8HFNiqpgBsUWw/edit?usp=sharing) for Google Calendar integration

Note: I call it TRD (Test Requirements Document) where also includes test plan (list of tests) and test approach.

## Test automation:

Automations are placed under [automation](./automation) folder:

- [api](./automation/api) for Item Management API testing
- [ui](./automation/ui) for Item Management UI testing
- [integrations](./automation/integrations) for Google Calendar integration testing

Under each automation project, there is a README where you can find guide to run tests:

- [API](./automation/api/README.md) for Item Management API testing
- [UI](./automation/ui/README.md) for Item Management UI testing
- [Integration](./automation/integrations/README.md) for Item Management UI testing. For test approach, Only tests that the integration has been setup in advance are automated this time.
