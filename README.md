# Guide to this assigment

## Test plans:

All test plans are placed under [test-plans](./test-plans) folder:

- [Item-management-feature-TRD.pdf](./test-plans/Item-management-feature-TRD.pdf) for Item Management feature
- [Google-calendar-integration-TRD.pdf](./test-plans/Google-calendar-integration-TRD.pdf) for Google Calendar integration

Note: I call it TRD (Test Requirements Document) where also includes test plan (list of tests) and test approach.

## Test automation:

Automations are placed under [automation](./automation) folder:

- [api](./automation/api) for Item Management API testing
- [ui](./automation/ui) for Item Management UI testing
- Unfortunately, due to time limitation from my current job, I haven't been able to provide an automation solution for Google Calendar integration. I would appreciate if reviewers could evaluate my automation skills via its TRD. I would be happy to implement the automation for it on the incoming weekends if I may.

Under each automation project, there is a README where you can find guide to run tests:

- [API](./automation/api/README.md) for Item Management API testing
- [UI](./automation/ui/README.md) for Item Management UI testing
